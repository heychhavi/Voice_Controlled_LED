# Voice_Controlled_LED

The main idea of the project is to control LED lights using voice commands.

We used python for giving voice commands to the microcontroller i.e Atmega 32A 16PU. For interfacing between Python and Microcontroller we used USART communication using TTL module.
Using python and Google Speech recognition we are recognizing the commands that user gives.The database of the words or numbers are from Google server.
